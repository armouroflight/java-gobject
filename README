= About =

This project can be used to generate Java classes to integrate with
Gnome gobjects.  Velocity templates are used to generate the Java
source in a flexible manner

= BUILDING =

You must have gobject-introspection and Python >= 2.3 installed.
Additional Java depenendencies can be found in pom.xml

Standard maven commands can be used to compile:
mvn compile jar:jar

= TODO =
1. Complete generation of simple Java classes
2. Command line arguments
3. Wrapper shell scripts
4. Build in compiler using http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/tools/JavaCompiler.html

== With thanks ==

This project is heavily indebted to the JGIR project http://live.gnome.org/JGIR
which provided the initial code for integrating with gnome goject-introspection.

JGIR creates class files directly which turned out to be more complex than I
needed, but some people may want to look into it.
