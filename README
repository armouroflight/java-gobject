= About =

This project can be used to generate Java classes to integrate with
Gnome gobjects.

= BUILDING =

You must have gobject-introspection and Python >= 2.3 installed.
Additionally, the project depends on the following Java libraries:
JNA: https://jna.dev.java.net/

On Fedora:
yum install objectweb-asm jna gnu-getopt

== With thanks ==

This project is heavily indebted to the JGIR project http://live.gnome.org/JGIR
which provided the initial code for integrating with gnome goject-introspection.

JGIR creates class files directly which turned out to be more complex than I
needed, but some people may want to look into it.
