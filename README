= BUILDING =

You must have gobject-introspection and Python >= 2.3 installed.
Additionally, the project depends on the following Java libraries:
ASM: http://asm.objectweb.org/index.html
JNA: https://jna.dev.java.net/
gnu-getopt: http://www.urbanophile.com/arenn/hacking/download.html

On Fedora:
yum install objectweb-asm jna gnu-getopt

Internally, the waf (http://code.google.com/p/waf/) build system is
used, but a simple "configure" and "Makefile" wrapper is provided.
You may use the standard:

./configure --prefix=...
make 
sudo make install

= Using =

After installation, you can run the script:

jgir-compile-all

This will generate .jar files for each .typelib file you have
installed.
