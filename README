= BUILDING =

You must have gobject-introspection and Python >= 2.3 installed.
Internally, the waf (http://code.google.com/p/waf/) build system is
used, but a simple "configure" and "Makefile" wrapper is provided.
You may use the standard:

./configure --prefix=...
make 
sudo make install

= Using =

After installation, you can run the script:

jgir-compile-all

This will generate .jar files for each .typelib file you have
installed.
